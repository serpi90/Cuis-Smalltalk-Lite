It will surely conflict with other package. Use the traditional isXXX in such cases				- In any case, asking these kinds of questions is a sign of poor design. If possible, avoid the question altogether, using, for example, double dispatching.				- if a class happens to answer true for several Symbols, consider implementing it like:			^#(symbol1 symbol2 symbol3) pointsTo: aSymbol		"		"Enable this to log improper calls to the Transcript..."	"	aSymbol class == Symbol ifFalse: [ thisContext sender sender print. aSymbol print ].	"	^false! !!CodeProvider methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'jmv 2/28/2011 15:44'!is: aSymbol	^(#(CodeProvider #ShoutEnabled) pointsTo: aSymbol)		or: [ super is: aSymbol ]! !

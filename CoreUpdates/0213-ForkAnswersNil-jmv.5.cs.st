But it might return afterwards.		This means it is very dangerous to use the returned process in code that stores it in some variable 	and checks for nil to start a new one. If this methods happens to return after the new process is forked,	chances are the code that starts all this runs again, that variable is nil, and a second process is forked,	perhaps breaking some shared state. This kind of bug is hard to spot and debug.		Callers wanting the new process object, should call #newProcess, store the answer, and then #resume.		A way to ensure this bug will not ever happen again is just to answer nil"	self newProcess resume.	^nil! !!BlockContext methodsFor: 'scheduling' stamp: 'jmv 6/15/2009 11:21'!forkAt: priority 	"Create and schedule a Process running the code in the receiver at the given priority."		"jmv - Do NOT answer the new process.	Please see the comment at #fork"	| forkedProcess |	forkedProcess _ self newProcess.	forkedProcess priority: priority.	forkedProcess resume.	^nil! !!BlockContext methodsFor: 'scheduling' stamp: 'jmv 6/15/2009 11:22'!forkAt: priority named: name	"Create and schedule a Process running the code in the receiver at the	given priority and having the given name."		"jmv - Do NOT answer the new process.	Please see the comment at #fork"	| forkedProcess |	forkedProcess := self newProcess.	forkedProcess priority: priority.	forkedProcess name: name.	 forkedProcess resume.	^nil! !!BlockContext methodsFor: 'scheduling' stamp: 'jmv 6/15/2009 11:22'!forkNamed: aString	"Create and schedule a Process running the code in the receiver and	having the given name."		"jmv - Do NOT answer the new process.	Please see the comment at #fork"	self newProcess name: aString; resume.	^nil! !

This message is sent when the given morph first receives a mouse-down event. If the mouse button goes up, then down again within DoubleClickTime, then 'doubleClick: evt' is sent to the morph. If the mouse button goes up but not down again within DoubleClickTime, then the message 'click: evt' is sent to the morph. Finally, if the button does not go up within DoubleClickTime, then 'drag: evt' is sent to the morph. In all cases, the event supplied is the original mouseDown event that initiated the gesture. mouseMove: and mouseUp: events are not sent to the morph until it becomes the mouse focus, which is typically done by the client in its click:, doubleClick:, or drag: methods." 	mouseClickState _ 		MouseClickState new			client: aMorph 			click: clkSel 			dblClick: dblClkSel			tripleClick: tripleClkSel			event: evt			sendMouseButton2Activity: Preferences tapAndHoldEmulatesButton2! !!Preferences class methodsFor: 'standard queries' stamp: 'jmv 9/30/2011 17:08'!tapAndHoldEmulatesButton2	"	Preferences enable: #tapAndHoldEmulatesButton2	Preferences disable: #tapAndHoldEmulatesButton2	"	^ self		valueOfFlag: #tapAndHoldEmulatesButton2		ifAbsent: [ true ].! !
